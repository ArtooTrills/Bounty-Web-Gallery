Create an image gallery component that shows image and information about that image

Consider a web page which has a dozen pictures. Each picture has some details - title, time the picture was taken, location of where the picture was taken (latitude, longitude)

When you click on any one picture you see the picture alongwith all the details in a panel. You also see the location on a map with some details additional details fetched from Google maps

You also see title and have an option to update the title.

Build this as a component using Ember, Angular or React.js
